This photograph captures one of those **unexpected moments of beauty** that can be found in the most mundane places - a terminal at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport during a layover that would change my perspective on travel photography forever.


I was rushing through Terminal 3, juggling my camera bag and boarding pass, when this scene stopped me dead in my tracks. The afternoon sun was streaming through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows, casting these *incredible golden rays* across the polished marble floors. But what caught my eye wasn't the architecture or the bustling crowds - it was this single, vibrant yellow drink sitting abandoned on a table.

**The drink** - what I later learned was a fresh mango lassi from one of the terminal's Indian cuisine vendors - sat perfectly positioned in a shaft of sunlight. The golden hour light was hitting it at just the right angle, making the yellow liquid seem to glow from within like liquid sunshine. The contrast was striking: the cool, sterile environment of the airport terminal against this warm, inviting splash of color.
