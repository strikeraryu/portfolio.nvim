On my trip to **Kodai**, we spotted this tower from Coaker’s Walk, hidden in the fog. I was so excited to capture it—took multiple shots, with and without fog, close and far.

Later, while we were desperately looking for good food, we found this cozy cafe with a great vibe. I tried something new—gingerbread coffee—for the first time.

While waiting for my coffee, I looked outside… and saw the same tower again.
