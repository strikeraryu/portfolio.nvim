Planned a solo trip to **Rishikesh**. Booked Zostel and buses in advance.
My bus reached at 7 AM, but check-in was at 11 AM.

To pass time, I went for a walk in the mountains while listening to audiobook **"Man’s Search for Meaning"**.
Cold breeze, quiet trails.

Reached a cliff and paused. In front of me — layered mountains, bare winter trees, and that classic scenery we all used to draw as kids.
