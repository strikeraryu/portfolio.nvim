Left for **Skandagiri** with friends at midnight. In the middle of Bangalore, my rented Activa broke down. Me and one of my friend were just roaming around, waiting for the mechanic, while everyone else had already left.

Thatâ€™s when we saw this dog, sitting peacefully in front of the police station, quietly staring at the light.
