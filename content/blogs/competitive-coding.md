_French, Mandarin, and Spanish_ — everyone wants to learn a new language and expand their knowledge of a new culture. However, as our lives increasingly revolve around technology, there are other languages that are an immense asset- **Programming languages**.

Programming Languages

Learning a new **programming language** is more than just a valuable addition to one’s **portfolio**; it has become an indispensable skill in our digital age. As **virtual platforms** replace traditional **classrooms**, and apps like **Notion** streamline our **note-taking** _(saying this while using it to write the blog_ 😂), even something as simple as ordering takeout through **Zomato** involves the language of code working behind the scenes. And I can go on about the essence of learning a new **programming language**, but I believe my argument is now clear and compelling.

## **What will help you gain an edge?**

Let’s delve into how one can truly **excel** in the world of **programming**. This is where **competitive coding** comes into play, and it’s just “_an intimidating word for_ **_problem-solving_** _using some_ **_programming language”_**. Yeah, and I don’t think there is anything else to say about it. You can get very complex definitions for this like the example presented below from **chat GPT**. But rest assured, The concept is as straightforward as I described it.

But when it comes to practising **competitive coding**, things can get tricky, much like doing a workout. The concept is simple: “_training your body to gain strength and balance_” but the execution is where the challenge lies. Learning a **programming language** may be easy, but it becomes your most potent asset when you consistently practice it, and **competitive coding** offers no better way to achieve that.

## The New Era of Competitive Coding with AI

I believe we are in a new era for **competitive coding** because it has never been easier to adopt it as a habit. There are numerous platforms and excellent educational resources available, including **AI** tools like **Large language models** (**LLMs**) such as **Chat GPT**, which have become key enablers. In the past, resources were scarce, and there was little support available. Now, with AI assistance like **Chat GPT**, individuals can jump-start their **competitive coding** journey, benefiting especially those in the early stages.

> The ease and potential of AI usage have grown tremendously, and accessibility has significantly improved over the past years.

In the following discussion, I will explain how you can utilize **Chat GPT** as your **competitive coding companion**, drawing insights from **Scaler’s approach** (_based on first-hand information_ 😜).

## GPT- Your competitive coding companion

### Step 1: Set GPT Thermostat 🌡️

There is **one key point** we should address first. When generating responses from **GPT**, it can generate either from pure imagination or based on real facts. You can control this behaviour using the ‘**Temperature**’ argument, which ranges from **0 to 2**. For the task of problem-solving, a good range is typically **0.5 to 0.9**. This allows **GPT** to be innovative while avoiding excessive hallucinations.

To specify the ‘**Temperature**’ in the GPT playground, there is a direct option for that. However, when using a **GPT chatbot**, you can set the ‘**Temperature**’ at the start of your conversation like this:

> use “temperature” value x on our conversation

**A fun activity to try 💻**, set a **high-temperature** value and ask some questions about non-existing things as I asked about the **red peacock**. Then ask the same question with a **low-temperature** value.

**Example for a high-temperature value (2)**

**Same example for a low-temperature value (0)**

![Low-temperature example](/assets/blogs/competitive-coding/low-temp.png)

This shows how **temperature** can affect your response and stop **GPT** from hallucinating.

### Step 2: Know your stage 🧐

When working on a coding problem, it’s common to encounter multiple stages where you might get stuck, and sometimes these stages can appear quite similar. To effectively overcome these obstacles, it’s crucial to pinpoint the key issue causing the blockage. Let’s explore each stage and how you can recognise them:

1. **The Problem Statement Stage:** Explain the problem and craft your own test case.
2. **The Ideation Stage:** Develop common logic applicable to multiple cases.
3. **The Approach Stage:** Ensure your approach handles all edge cases and constraints.
4. **The Implementation: Syntax Stage:** Compilation errors indicate syntax issues.
5. **The Implementation: Logical Stage:** Wrong approach or incorrect implementation leading to failed cases.

### Step 3: Start prompting ⌨️

To make the most of GPT as your problem companion, follow these steps to set up the conversation (A full sample conversation is linked later):

1. **Set the Role, Parameters, and Tone** – e.g., *You are my personal problem-solving companion … never give me direct solutions …*
2. **Getting help for the Problem Statement** – ask GPT to rephrase or give analogies.
3. **Ideation** – ask for hints: challenges, insights, intuition, DS/Algo, then solution hints.
4. **Implementation** – syntax help by sharing code snippets; logical help by asking GPT to evaluate approach or locate logic errors using structured prompts.

> **Note:** Always use clear structure, correct delimiters, and avoid typos in your prompts to keep GPT on track.

## Let’s see how Scaler did it

![Scaler news post](/assets/blogs/competitive-coding/scaler-news.png)

There are multiple news posts regarding how **Scaler** has embraced **cutting-edge AI**, utilizing a model like **Chat GPT** to revolutionize the learning experience. **Scaler** leverages the same core principles discussed earlier to assist learners throughout their journey.

With **AI** as an ally, **Scaler** has transformed the way learners tackle challenges, opening up new possibilities and revolutionizing the future of upskilling.

In conclusion, **competitive coding** can be an incredibly rewarding hobby, and the vast potential of **GPT** can assist you in ways you may not have imagined.

I hope you enjoyed reading the blog and gained valuable insights from it. **Happy coding!** 🔥
