**Striker** is a backend and DevOps engineer based in Bengaluru who’s allergic to GUIs and thinks a mouse is a design flaw. He works at HackerRank and spends most of his waking hours inside a terminal, hopping between tmux panes, split windows, and Neovim buffers like it’s a competitive sport. His workflow is powered by a split keyboard that no one else in the room knows how to use, running on Ghostty and Amethyst like he’s training for the Vim Olympics.

When he’s not debugging infrastructure or automating yet another thing that didn’t need automating, he’s out running absurd distances for fun, reading three books at once, or practicing cardistry because keyboards weren’t hard enough. He plays chess and poker like he’s about to make a Netflix docuseries, and somehow finds time to shoot clean visuals on his Sony ZV-E10. If he’s quiet, he’s probably either watching a slow-burn anime or figuring out how to turn his hobbies into GitHub contributions. Efficient to a fault, and mildly unapproachable during deep work hours, Striker is either building cool things or roasting bad tooling in his head.
