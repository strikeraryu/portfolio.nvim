**Striker** is a backend and DevOps engineer at HackerRank, based in Bengaluru. He lives in the terminal, swears by Vim, and uses a split keyboard like it’s a personality trait. Obsessed with performance, he avoids GUIs like malware and endlessly tweaks dotfiles for fun. When not deep in infra or debugging edge cases, he’s out running, reading, shooting with his Sony ZV-E10, doing cardistry, losing at chess and poker, or pretending magic tricks count as social skills.
